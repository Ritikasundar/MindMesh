CALVIN CYCLE STEPS

  Carbon Fixation
    CO2 is brought into plant.
      CO2 attaches to carbon.
        Rubisco speeds up reaction.
          Rubisco, a common protein.
            Attaches carbon to RuBP.
              Creates a six-carbon molecule.
                Splits into two chemicals.
                  Each with three carbons.

  Reduction
    ATP and NADPH transform.
      Three-carbon molecules to sugar.
        Sugar molecules called G3P.
          Stands for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

  Carbohydrate Formation
    Some G3P leaves the cycle.
      Converts into bigger sugars.
        Such as glucose (C6H12O6).

  Regeneration
    Leftover G3P uses ATP.
      Picks up two more carbons.
        Becomes RuBP.
          Pairs with rubisco.
            Ready for next CO2.
              Starts the cycle again.
